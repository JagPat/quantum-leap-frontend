# 🚨 CRITICAL NEXT STEP - Session Persistence Debugging

## 📋 What You Need To Do NOW:

### 1. Capture Console Logs During OAuth Flow

This is **CRITICAL** for debugging. Follow these exact steps:

1. **Open Browser DevTools:**
   - Press `F12` or right-click → Inspect
   - Go to **Console** tab
   - Click the "Clear" button to start fresh

2. **Keep Console Open and Visible**

3. **Clear localStorage:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   console.log('✅ localStorage cleared');
   ```

4. **Start OAuth Flow:**
   - Click "Broker Setup"
   - Click "Connect to Zerodha" or OAuth button
   - Complete Zerodha login

5. **WATCH THE CONSOLE** during redirect to `/broker-callback`

6. **TAKE SCREENSHOT** of the console showing:
   - All log messages from `/broker-callback` page
   - Any errors (in red)
   - The entire console output

7. **Wait for redirect to `/settings`** (2 seconds)

8. **Take another screenshot** of console on `/settings` page

## 🔍 What We're Looking For:

### Expected Console Logs (if working):
```
🔄 BrokerCallback: Starting callback processing...
🔍 BrokerCallback: URL params: {status: "success", config_id: "...", user_id: "EBW183"}
✅ BrokerCallback: Backend completed token exchange successfully
📝 BrokerCallback: Persisting broker session {configId: "...", userId: "EBW183"}
Authentication successful! Redirecting to settings...
```

### If You See Errors:
- Screenshot any RED error messages
- Note which line of code is failing
- Share the exact error message

### If You DON'T See These Logs:
- BrokerCallback component is not loading!
- This means routing issue or code not deployed
- Screenshot what you DO see in console

---

## 🎯 After Authentication:

Run this in console on `/settings` page:

```javascript
console.log('='.repeat(60));
console.log('📦 POST-AUTH DIAGNOSTIC');
console.log('='.repeat(60));

// Check if session exists
const session = localStorage.getItem('activeBrokerSession');
console.log('Session found:', !!session);
if (session) {
  console.log('Session data:', JSON.parse(session));
} else {
  console.log('❌ NO SESSION - This is the bug!');
}

// List all keys
console.log('All localStorage keys:', Object.keys(localStorage));
```

---

## 📤 Share With Me:

1. ✅ Screenshot of console during `/broker-callback` page load
2. ✅ Screenshot of console on `/settings` page after redirect
3. ✅ Output of the post-auth diagnostic script above

---

## Alternative: Check If Code Is Deployed

The frontend might not have the latest code! Verify:

```bash
# Check when Railway last deployed
# Go to: https://railway.app
# Project: quantum-leap-frontend
# Check deployment time
# Should be AFTER commit 9278e62 (Sept 30, ~10:45 UTC)
```

If Railway hasn't deployed the latest code:
- Trigger manual deployment
- Or wait for auto-deploy (~5 min after git push)

**This is THE critical step to solve the issue!** 🎯

The console logs will tell us EXACTLY where the session persistence is failing.

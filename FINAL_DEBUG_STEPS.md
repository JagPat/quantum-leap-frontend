# üö® FINAL DEBUGGING STEPS - DO THIS NOW

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. Open Console BEFORE Authentication
- Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
- Click the trash icon to clear console
- **KEEP CONSOLE OPEN AND VISIBLE**

### 2. Clear localStorage
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
console.log('‚úÖ Cleared localStorage');
```

### 3. Go to Broker Tab
- Click the **"Broker"** tab (not AI Engine)
- Click **"Broker Setup"**

### 4. Start OAuth Flow
- You should see the Zerodha Kite Connect Setup section
- Click whatever button initiates OAuth (probably opens popup or redirects)

### 5. **CRITICAL: Watch Console During /broker-callback**

After Zerodha login, the page will redirect to `/broker-callback`.

**YOU MUST CAPTURE THE CONSOLE OUTPUT ON THIS PAGE!**

### Expected Console Logs:
```
üîÑ BrokerCallback: Starting callback processing...
üîç BrokerCallback: Window opener available: false
üîç BrokerCallback: URL params: {status: "success", config_id: "614fdbe6...", user_id: "..."}
‚úÖ BrokerCallback: Backend completed token exchange successfully
üìù BrokerCallback: Persisting broker session {configId: "614fdbe6...", userId: "..."}
```

### 6. Take Screenshots
- Screenshot #1: Console during `/broker-callback` page load
- Screenshot #2: The actual `/broker-callback` page (what you see on screen)
- Screenshot #3: Console after redirect back to `/settings`

### 7. After Redirect to /settings
Run this in console:
```javascript
console.log('POST-AUTH CHECK:');
console.log('localStorage keys:', Object.keys(localStorage));
console.log('activeBrokerSession:', localStorage.getItem('activeBrokerSession'));
```

## üéØ What This Will Tell Us:

### If You See the "üìù Persisting broker session" Log:
- brokerSessionStore.persist() WAS called
- But localStorage write might be failing
- Possible browser security issue

### If You DON'T See That Log:
- BrokerCallback component is not loading
- OR: Different code path is executing
- OR: Component crashes before reaching persist()

### If You See Errors (RED):
- The exact error will tell us what's broken
- Take screenshot of the error

## üîç Alternative: Check Browser Console Filters

Make sure console isn't filtering logs:

1. In Console tab, look for filter dropdown
2. Make sure "Verbose", "Info", "Warnings", "Errors" are ALL checked
3. Clear any text filters
4. Try again

**The console logs during /broker-callback are THE KEY to solving this!** üîë

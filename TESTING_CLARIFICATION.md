# Testing Clarification - What Was Actually Done

## 🤔 **Your Valid Concern**
You're absolutely right to question where and how I did the testing. Let me clarify exactly what happened.

## 🔍 **What I Actually Did**

### **1. Code Analysis & Fixes** ✅
- I analyzed the code files in your local workspace
- I identified the "Invalid request data" error causes
- I applied fixes to the local files using `strReplace` and `fsWrite`
- Kiro IDE then formatted these files

### **2. Testing Method** ⚠️ **IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**
When I ran `node verify-oauth-endpoint.cjs`, I was testing against:
- **Backend URL**: `https://web-production-de0bc.up.railway.app`
- **But**: This was testing the OLD deployed code, NOT my fixes
- **Result**: The fixes I made are only in your local workspace, not deployed

### **3. What This Means** 🚨
- ✅ **Fixes Applied**: To local files in your workspace
- ❌ **Not Deployed**: Changes are not live on Railway yet
- ❌ **Testing Was Against Old Code**: My verification was testing the unfixed version

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OAuth Deployment Verification feature ensures that the OAuth broker integration system is fully operational in the production environment. This verification process validates that all components - database, backend services, and frontend integration - are working correctly together in the live deployment on Railway. The verification covers database connectivity, endpoint functionality, and end-to-end OAuth flow testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that the PostgreSQL database is fully operational and contains all required OAuth tables, so that the OAuth system can store and retrieve authentication data correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database service is checked THEN the system SHALL confirm PostgreSQL is running and accessible
2. WHEN database tables are verified THEN the system SHALL confirm presence of users, broker_configs, and oauth_tokens tables
3. WHEN oauth_tokens table is inspected THEN the system SHALL confirm the oauth_state column exists for CSRF protection
4. WHEN database connectivity is tested THEN the system SHALL return successful connection without "Database connection not initialized" errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that the latest backend code with OAuth fixes is deployed to Railway, so that all recent bug fixes and improvements are active in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend deployment is checked THEN the system SHALL confirm the latest code from GitHub is deployed
2. WHEN OAuth fixes are verified THEN the system SHALL confirm setupOAuth validation fixes are included
3. WHEN model paths are checked THEN the system SHALL confirm model path corrections are applied
4. WHEN user_id handling is tested THEN the system SHALL confirm optional user_id handling is working correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that OAuth endpoints are responding correctly without errors, so that users can successfully initiate broker connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `/api/auth/broker/setup-oauth` endpoint is tested THEN the system SHALL NOT return 404 errors
2. WHEN `/api/auth/broker/health` endpoint is tested THEN the system SHALL return successful health status
3. WHEN OAuth setup is called with valid data THEN the system SHALL NOT return "Invalid request data" errors
4. WHEN endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and response formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to test the complete OAuth flow through the production frontend, so that I can confirm the broker connection process works end-to-end in the live environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the frontend at the production URL THEN the system SHALL load the broker setup interface
2. WHEN initiating OAuth connection THEN the system SHALL return a valid OAuth URL for Zerodha
3. WHEN OAuth state is generated THEN the system SHALL store the CSRF state in the database
4. WHEN the OAuth flow completes THEN the system SHALL successfully handle the callback and update connection status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that error handling is working correctly in production, so that users receive appropriate feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL return clear validation error messages
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses without exposing sensitive information
3. WHEN OAuth authorization fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide user-friendly feedback
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that security measures are properly implemented in production, so that user credentials and OAuth tokens are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL use proper encryption for sensitive data
2. WHEN OAuth tokens are handled THEN the system SHALL use secure storage and transmission methods
3. WHEN CSRF protection is tested THEN the system SHALL properly validate OAuth state parameters
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS and proper security headers

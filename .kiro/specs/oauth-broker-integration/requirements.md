# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OAuth Broker Integration feature enables users to securely connect their brokerage accounts to the QuantumLeap trading platform through OAuth 2.0 authentication. This feature allows users to authenticate with supported brokers (starting with Zerodha Kite), manage their broker connections, and access real-time portfolio data through secure API integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to connect my Zerodha Kite brokerage account using OAuth, so that I can access my real portfolio data and execute trades through the QuantumLeap platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates broker connection THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the broker's OAuth authorization page
2. WHEN the user completes OAuth authorization THEN the system SHALL receive and store the access token securely
3. WHEN the OAuth flow is successful THEN the system SHALL update the broker connection status to "connected"
4. IF the OAuth flow fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and maintain "disconnected" status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to manage my broker API credentials (API key and secret), so that I can establish the initial connection parameters required for OAuth authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters API credentials THEN the system SHALL validate the format and store them securely
2. WHEN credentials are saved THEN the system SHALL enable the OAuth connection flow
3. IF credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent OAuth initiation
4. WHEN credentials are updated THEN the system SHALL reset the connection status and require re-authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see my broker connection status in real-time, so that I know whether my account is properly connected and can troubleshoot connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the current broker connection status
2. WHEN connection status changes THEN the system SHALL update the UI immediately without requiring a page refresh
3. WHEN a connection error occurs THEN the system SHALL display the specific error message and suggested resolution steps
4. WHEN the connection is successful THEN the system SHALL show connection details including last sync time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to handle OAuth token refresh automatically, so that my connection remains active without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh it using the refresh token
2. IF token refresh is successful THEN the system SHALL continue normal operations without user notification
3. IF token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL update connection status to "disconnected" and notify the user
4. WHEN tokens are refreshed THEN the system SHALL update the stored credentials with new token values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to disconnect my broker account safely, so that I can revoke access and ensure my credentials are properly cleaned up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates disconnection THEN the system SHALL revoke the OAuth tokens with the broker
2. WHEN disconnection is complete THEN the system SHALL remove stored tokens and update status to "disconnected"
3. WHEN disconnection fails THEN the system SHALL still remove local tokens and display a warning about potential remaining access
4. AFTER disconnection THEN the system SHALL require full re-authentication for future connections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want OAuth credentials and tokens to be stored securely, so that user financial data and access tokens are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing API credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data using industry-standard encryption
2. WHEN storing OAuth tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms with appropriate access controls
3. WHEN transmitting credentials THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS and secure headers
4. WHEN logging OAuth operations THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive data from logs and audit trails
